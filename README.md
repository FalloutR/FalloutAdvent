## Advent Of Code Completed by FalloutR
Each problem is completed in a Juypter Notebook and can be found in the src folder.

Nothing special, if I think there is anything of note I will list the problem file here.

```
ac2.ipynb - implemented using a session cookie on third cell, every problem from then should use it
ac4.ipynb - started using function declarations so the code is more easily managed/read
```
